# Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data, meaning data that is already tagged with the correct answer. The supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used to map new examples.
### Labeled Data: 
In supervised learning, each example in the training data is labeled with the correct answer. For example, if the task is to classify images of cats and dogs, each image would be labeled as either "cat" or "dog".

## Types of Supervised Learning:

### Classification: 
This involves predicting a categorical label. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam.
### Regression: 
This involves predicting a continuous value. For example, predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
## Training Process: 
During training, the algorithm learns the relationship between the input features and the corresponding labels. The goal is to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output.

## Model Evaluation:
Once trained, the model needs to be evaluated on a separate dataset (validation or test set) to assess its performance. Common metrics for evaluation include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score (for classification), and mean squared error (for regression).

## Examples of Algorithms:
There are various supervised learning algorithms, including:

- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks
